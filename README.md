# An informal tutorial on Linear Mixed Models

Tutorial on Linear Mixed Models presented in a seminar in my research group on March 31st, 2020. This is a very informal summary of what I though I knew at the time after having to get familiar with linear mixed models very well very quickly. Don't expect much of it to be perfectly accuracy. I assume you're here for the memes in the slides or for this animation:
